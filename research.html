      <b>Analysis of Immigration Patterns Pre and Post Democratic Transition: Evidence from Tunisia.</b>
      <i>Journal of Development and Economic Policies</i>, 2024.
      <br/>
      <span class="small">
This paper delves into the impact of Tunisia’s democratic transition, stemming from the Arab
Spring, on immigration patterns. Leveraging data from four waves of the Arab Barometer Survey,
the study employs a Probit model to scrutinise shifts in the probability of immigration pre and
post the democratic transition. The paper extends to a robustness check via a Changes-in-Changes
framework, with Tunisia as a treatment group and Algeria as a control group. Findings indicate that
immigration patterns in Tunisia have not diminished post-democratic transition but have instead
intensified. This trend is supported by the Chow Test. Moreover, the study reveals the presence of
the brain drain phenomenon. On average, Tunisians demonstrate an increased inclination toward
immigration post-democratic transition compared to Algerians. These patterns could be attributed
to unmet economic demands precipitating the 2011 revolution, coupled with expectations of swift
reforms, and the subsequent lack of immediate improvements in economic conditions following
democratisation.
